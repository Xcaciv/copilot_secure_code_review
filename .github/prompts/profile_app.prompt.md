- Document data flows between components and external systems
- Note data retention policies if present

### User Roles & Access Control
- Map the complete role hierarchy and permission structure
- Identify privilege escalation paths
- Analyze role separation enforcement mechanisms
- Document how access control decisions are made and enforced

## 2. LANGUAGE & FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

### Programming Language
- Identify the primary programming language(s) and version(s)
- Note language-specific security concerns and common vulnerabilities
- Flag unsafe language features or functions being used
- Identify coding patterns that might introduce security issues

### Development Framework
- Determine the framework(s) in use and their versions
- Evaluate built-in security features and their implementation
- Identify if the framework version has known vulnerabilities
- Analyze framework configuration for security best practices

### Architecture Pattern
- Document the architectural pattern(s) (MVC, Microservices, etc.)
- Analyze security boundaries between components
- Evaluate trust relationships between architectural elements
- Assess overall architectural security design

### Build & Deployment
- Review CI/CD pipeline security controls
- Analyze deployment configuration for security issues
- Examine containerization or virtualization security
- Identify environment-specific configurations and security implications

## 3. COMPONENTS & LIBRARIES ANALYSIS

### Security Components
- Identify authentication libraries and implementation details
- Document authorization components and access control libraries
- Analyze encryption/cryptography implementations
- Review input validation and output encoding libraries

### Database Components
- Identify ORMs, query builders, and database drivers
- Analyze how SQL queries are constructed and executed
- Review parameterization practices and injection prevention
- Examine data access patterns for security issues

### Frontend Components
- Analyze JavaScript frameworks and their security implications
- Review client-side validation and security controls
- Examine DOM manipulation and XSS prevention mechanisms
- Evaluate frontend/backend trust boundaries

### API & Integration Components
- Identify API clients and third-party service SDKs
- Review API security controls (authentication, rate limiting, etc.)
- Analyze how API keys and secrets are managed
- Evaluate input validation for external data sources

## 4. DATASTORES & TEMPLATING ANALYSIS

### Datastores
- Document all databases, caches, and storage mechanisms
- Review database security configurations
- Analyze connection security and credential management
- Identify backup and recovery mechanisms

### Database Schema
- Analyze table structures and relationships
- Review schema security controls (constraints, triggers)
- Identify sensitive data storage patterns
- Evaluate data integrity controls

### Data Access Patterns
- Document how the application queries data
- Review transaction handling security
- Analyze privilege management for data access
- Identify potential for data leakage

### Templating Engines
- Identify template engines and rendering mechanisms
- Review how user data is incorporated into templates
- Analyze output encoding and XSS prevention
- Evaluate template inclusion security

## 5. CONFIGURATION & ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS

### Configuration Files
- Identify all configuration files and their purposes
- Flag hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive values
- Review environment-specific configurations
- Analyze security-critical configuration options

### Environment Variables
- Document environment variables used by the application

## ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS

Perform a comprehensive code analysis to extract the above information. Focus on security-critical aspects of the application. Your analysis should include:

1. **Code Inspection**: Analyze source code, comments, and documentation
2. **Configuration Review**: Examine configuration files, environment settings
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Review third-party libraries and components
4. **Data Flow Mapping**: Trace how data moves through the application
5. **Security Control Identification**: Document security mechanisms
6. **Vulnerability Pattern Recognition**: Identify code patterns that could lead to vulnerabilities

Compile your findings into a detailed security-focused report organized according to the sections above. For each identified risk or security concern, provide specific code references and concrete recommendations for remediation.
